# CHC Secure File Management System

A secure file management system that implements **blockchain-linked contextual encryption** for maximum security and controlled access. This system demonstrates advanced cryptographic techniques including Contextual Hash Chain (CHC) encryption, blockchain integration, and per-user access control.

> **Frontend**: The system uses a modern React + TypeScript + Vite frontend (`CHCAPP/`) with a Flask backend API server.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Process Flow

### Process 1: File Upload and Encryption

This process handles secure file upload, encryption, and storage with blockchain integration:

#### Step 1: User Uploads File
- User selects a file through the web interface
- File is validated (size, format, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: If upload fails → Upload Error

#### Step 2: Generate File ID
- System generates a unique file identifier
- File ID is based on filename, owner, and timestamp

#### Step 3: Create Blockchain Block
- A new block is created in the blockchain
- Block contains file metadata (filename, size, owner, authorized users)

#### Step 4: Get Block Hash and Timestamp
- System retrieves the cryptographic hash of the block
- Timestamp is recorded for temporal context
- These values provide **contextual uniqueness** for encryption

#### Step 5: Derive Seed
- Encryption seed is derived using:
  - Owner's master secret
  - Block hash (from blockchain)
  - Timestamp
  - File ID
- This ensures **unique encryption** for each file

#### Step 6: Encrypt File with CHC Algorithm
- File is encrypted using Contextual Hash Chain (CHC) algorithm
- CHC provides **forward security** through state chaining
- Each block's encryption depends on previous ciphertext
- **Error Handling**: If encryption fails → Encryption Error

#### Step 7: Store Encrypted File Off Chain
- Encrypted file is stored in secure off-chain storage (Firestore)
- Only encrypted data is stored, never plaintext
- **Error Handling**: If storage fails → Storage Error

#### Step 8: Wrap Seeds for Authorized Users
- Encryption seed is wrapped (encrypted) for each authorized user
- Each user gets their own wrapped seed using their user key
- Owner also gets a wrapped seed for access

#### Step 9: Log to Blockchain for Access Control
- Access control information is logged to blockchain
- Includes: owner, authorized users, file ID, block hash
- Creates immutable audit trail
- **Error Handling**: If logging fails → Blockchain Logging Error

#### Step 10: File Securely Stored
- Process completes successfully
- File is encrypted, stored, and access control is enforced

---

### Process 2: File Decryption and Access

This process handles secure file retrieval, authorization, and decryption:

#### Step 1: User Requests Decryption
- User requests to decrypt and download a file
- User provides file ID and their username

#### Step 2: Retrieve Metadata from Blockchain
- System retrieves file metadata from blockchain
- Includes: file ID, owner, authorized users, block hash, timestamp
- **Error Handling**: If metadata not found → Retrieval Error

#### Step 3: Retrieve Encrypted File Off Chain
- System retrieves the encrypted file from off-chain storage
- File is fetched from secure storage (Firestore)
- **Error Handling**: If file not found → Retrieval Error

#### Step 4: Check Authorization
- System verifies if the requesting user is authorized
- Checks if user is the owner or in the authorized users list
- **Error Handling**: 
  - If not authorized → Not Authorized (access denied)
  - If error during check → Authorization Error

#### Step 5: Unwrap Seed
- If authorized, system retrieves the user's wrapped seed
- Seed is unwrapped (decrypted) using the user's key
- **Error Handling**: If seed unwrap fails → Decryption Error

#### Step 6: Decrypt File
- File is decrypted using CHC algorithm and the unwrapped seed
- CHC decryption reverses the encryption process
- Plaintext is reconstructed from ciphertext
- **Error Handling**: If decryption fails → Decryption Error

#### Step 7: Log Success to Blockchain
- Successful decryption is logged to blockchain
- Creates audit trail of authorized access
- **Error Handling**: If logging fails → Blockchain Logging Error

#### Step 8: File Decrypted
- Process completes successfully
- Decrypted file is returned to the user
- User can download and access the file

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend)
- One-time frontend install: run `npm install` inside `CHCAPP/`
- Firebase account (for cloud storage)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Project
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Firebase credentials and configuration
   - See `CREATE_ENV_FILE.md` for details

4. **Run both backend and frontend together (recommended for development)**
   ```bash
   # from the project root
   python dev_runner.py
   ```
   - On Windows PowerShell: `python .\dev_runner.py`
   - This starts:
     - Flask API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
     - Vite frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
   - Press Ctrl+C once to stop both processes gracefully.
   - Note: The script assumes you have already run `npm install` once inside `CHCAPP/`.

   If you prefer to run them separately:

   4.a **Run the backend (Flask API) only**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Backend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

5. **Run the frontend (CHCAPP) only**
   ```bash
   cd CHCAPP
   npm install   # or: yarn install
   npm run dev   # or: yarn dev
   ```
   Frontend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
   - Register a new user or login with existing credentials
   - Start uploading and managing files

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CHC Encryption Algorithm

The Contextual Hash Chain (CHC) algorithm provides forward security:

```python
# Seed Generation
seed = HMAC-SHA256(owner_secret, block_hash + timestamp + file_id)

# CHC Encryption (per block)
for each block i:
    keystream = HMAC(state, block_index)
    ciphertext = plaintext XOR keystream
    state = HMAC(state, ciphertext)
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Forward Security**: Each block's encryption depends on previous ciphertext
- **State Chaining**: State is updated with each encrypted block
- **Contextual Uniqueness**: Seed derived from blockchain context
- **Cryptographic Security**: HMAC-SHA256 for all operations

### Blockchain Integration

- **Immutable Records**: SHA-256 hash chain
- **Context Generation**: Block hash + timestamp for unique seeds
- **Audit Trail**: Complete access control logging
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic chain validation

### Key Management

- **Master Keys**: System and user master keys with Fernet encryption
- **Wrapped Seeds**: Per-user encrypted seeds for access control
- **Secure Storage**: Double-encrypted key vault
- **Key Derivation**: HMAC-based key generation

## 🧪 Testing

> ⚠️ **Automated tests are currently unavailable.**  
> The former `test/` directory (referenced in earlier documentation) has been removed during recent refactors, so the commands shown in older notes will fail.

Until the automated suite is rebuilt, you can verify the core workflow manually:

```bash
# 1. Start the backend API (from project root)
python app.py

# 2. In a second terminal, run the frontend
cd CHCAPP
npm install   # first run only
npm run dev

# 3. Use the UI to:
#    a) Register/login
#    b) Upload a file (with authorized users)
#    c) Decrypt as an authorized user
```

Manual verification checklist:
- ✅ Upload succeeds and shows a new block in the blockchain view
- ✅ Authorized users can decrypt and download the plaintext
- ✅ Unauthorized users receive “Access denied” and the attempt is logged
- ✅ `/api/security/<file_id>` reports a healthy audit trail

If you plan to reintroduce automated tests, recreate the `test/` directory and port the previous CHC flow tests or write fresh pytest suites that hit the REST endpoints.
